        <h2>Description</h2> 
        <p>
            This strawberry rhubarb crumble has a superb balance of sweet and tart and a crumble that delivers both a hint of lemon zest and the rich flavor of almonds.
        </p>
        <p>
            Served warm or at room temperature, with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream, it's the ultimate spring dessert.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li> 
        <li>1 cup slivered almonds</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
        <li>6 cups fresh strawberries, hulled and quartered</li>
        <li>4 cups fresh rhubarb, cut into 1/2-inch slices, or frozen unsweetened sliced rhubarb</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>sweetened whipped cream or vanilla ice cream (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>
                For topping, stir together flour, almonds, 3/4 cup sugar, melted butter, lemon zest, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl until clumps form.
                Cover and chill topping while preparing filling.
            </li>
            <li>For filling, combine strawberries and rhubarb in a very large bowl. In a small bowl stir together remaining 1 cup sugar, cornstarch, and salt; add to fruit and toss well to combine.</li>
            <li>Transfer filling to a 3-quart rectangular baking dish. If using frozen fruit, let fruit mixture stand for 45 minutes at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Cover filling with topping. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until fruit is bubbly in the center and topping is golden, about 1 hour  (1 1/2 hours if using frozen fruit). If topping is browning too quickly, cover with foil during the last 30 minutes of baking time. </li>
            <li>Let stand for 30 minutes before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature. If desired, serve with whipped cream or ice cream.</li>
