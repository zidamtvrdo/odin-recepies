    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is a very spicy recipe, so the quantities for the hot pepper components can be reduced for a milder final product.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is just enough salt in the soy sauce to season the chicken; if you like things highly seasoned you can add another 1/2 teaspoon salt to the marinade.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10 chicken drumsticks</li>
        <li>1 habanero pepper, seeded and halved</li>
        <li>1/4 cup rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon hot chili flakes</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Korean chili paste (gochujang)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons snipped fresh chives (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Transfer chicken drumsticks into a resealable plastic bag placed over a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add habanero pepper, rice vinegar, and soy sauce to a blender or blender cup, and blend on high for about 30 seconds. Transfer into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add honey, garlic powder, onion powder, chili flakes, cayenne, and chili paste to the bowl and whisk until evenly combined.</li>
        <li>Pour marinade into the bag with chicken, and carefully massage the outside of the bag until drumsticks are evenly coated. Squeeze out excess air and seal the bag tightly.</li>
        <li>Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to 10 hours for best results. (If necessary, chicken can be cooked immediately, but drumsticks will be more flavorful if marinated for a few hours.)</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Transfer chicken and marinade into a casserole dish, and space drumsticks evenly into a single layer.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes; remove from the oven and turn chicken pieces over. </li>
        <li>Continue to bake drumsticks until meat is very tender and beginning to brown, about 45 minutes more; turn or baste drumsticks every 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove drumsticks to a serving platter and cover loosely with foil. Carefully pour all the liquids from the roasting dish into a saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook sauce until it starts to thicken slightly, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spoon sauce over drumsticks. Scatter freshly snipped chives over chicken to serve.</li>
    </ol>
